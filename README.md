# My Online Wedding Invitation

Since my husband and I were aiming for a low budget wedding, I designed and created this online wedding invitation setup. This allowed me to create and track my guests, send emails, and more.

Since creating this, my skills have improved significantly, so stay tuned for a revamped version.
